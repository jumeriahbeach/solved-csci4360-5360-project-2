In this project, we are going to have a tournament style egg hunt competition. Each team designs and builds a reactive robot that “hunts” for Easter eggs by autonomously locating and pushing the plastic eggs into their own nest. The egg hunt takes place in an enclosed arena with “nests” at either end. The enclosure and the nests will be surrounded by wooden fence. The color of the nests will be easily distinguishable from the color of the rest of the arena. The enclosure will contain around 30 plastic eggs randomly scattered throughout. The objective of the game is for each team to gather into its nest as many eggs as possible within 2 minutes. The winner of a round is the team with more eggs. At the start of each round, each robot is placed next to its home nest. The home nest will be assigned at the beginning of each round. Your robot should be able to determine which side is its nest. Size limit on the overall structure of the robot (which includes any protruding parts) is 10” x 12”.

where each independent behavior of your robot is designed in the form of “releaser, perceptual schema, percept, motor schema”.

<ul>

 <li>Testing results of individual behaviors</li>

 <li>Printout of the robotC program developed for the behaviors.</li>

</ul>




<strong>Robot construction counts 20 pts: </strong>

Robot design according to the project requirements and the affordance found in the robot environment; good usage of sensors, motors and mechanical design for the task.







<strong>Second Stage (100 pts)</strong>             Assemble the behaviors. Modify individual behaviors as necessary.  Combine the individual behaviors for the task.




<strong>Second Demo (50 pts): </strong><strong>Thursday, April 6</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong>: </strong>In class demo will be done in round robin tournament style. Teams involved in each match will be determined at the beginning of the tournament by random draw.

<strong> </strong>

<strong><em>Report 2 due: midnight, </em></strong><strong>April 6</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong>. Report counts 20 points. This report should include:

<ul>

 <li>Description of test results for putting behaviors together;</li>

 <li>Describe any re-design/re-implementation/testing involved in the process, and</li>

 <li>the complete robotC program for your robot.</li>

</ul>




<strong>Robot construction</strong> <strong>counts 15 pts.</strong>

Robot design according to the project requirements and the affordance found in the environment; good usage of sensors, motors and mechanical design for the task.




<strong>Program development counts 15 pts:</strong>

Software supports the designed behaviors
